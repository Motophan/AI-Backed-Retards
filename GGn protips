Alright, so someone asked me to explain the GGn rpg to them. Instead of explaining this 100 times to 50 people (because no one listens the first time) I am going to just put my thoughts here.
There is an amazing guide written here about general site concepts https://GGN/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=3560
Here is a overview of the item system https://GGn/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=23687

No, go back and read those. Not kidding. What I write assumes you have read both of those. 



Ok, GGn's item system works on a leveling tree
bronze -> iron -> steel -> gold -> mithril -> adamant
quarts -> jade -> amethest

the metals ONLY boost upload.
The minerals boost upload and download.

You want to be boosted at 0x download all the time.
